==============

Mathsfunctions is a library of python scripts for solving high level classroom maths problems.

Current scripts:
* solvequadratic.py - solves quadratic equations. Input a, b, and c as command line arguaments.

Help for all scripts can be called using --help.

mf.py is the core library. It parses command line arguaments, returning them as integers, and runs the help commands when called for.
